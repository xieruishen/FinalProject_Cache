# FinalProject_Cache
The documentation counts for 55% of your grade whether you succeed at your goal or not. Did you shoot for the moon and land among the harsh vacuum of space? You still learned something from the process, and as long as you document it well, you will get full credit.

Documentation should be posted in the form of a project website (PDF or MarkDown in a repo can also be acceptable depending on the project) and must answer the following questions:

What did you do?
Your project abstract: one catchy sentence followed by a paragraph or two. The intended audience should include people that aren't necessarily versed in Computer Architecture, but are technically competent.

Why did you do it?
A paragraph or so about why the project you chose is worthwhile and interesting.

How did you do it?
This portion can assume an audience that has taken Computer Architecture, but don't let the story you’re telling get bogged down by buzzwords. A sure sign of a bad engineer is ORA (over reliance on acronyms).

How can someone else build on it?
Include everything necessary to pick up where you left off. This should include (as appropriate):

code
schematics
scripts and build instructions
proper attribution for resources used and anything you did not write yourself
list of difficulties and ‘gotchas’ while doing this project
reflection on the project as a whole as well as your work plan
possible TODOs to extend the depth of the project
This should all be posted somewhere accessible, e.g. your project webpage or repository. Please do not literally include these question prompts and then answer them (you're better than that) - instead, use them to check that you've covered all the bases as you tell the story in the way that best makes sense for your project.
